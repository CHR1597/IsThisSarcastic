Humans struggle to recognise sarcasm in written statements as easily as we can in person. However, our ability to discern written sarcasm improves considerably when we know more contextual details of the statement. This project presents /u/IsThisSarcastic, a Reddit bot for detecting sarcasm in comments using a combination of content and context. /u/IsThisSarcastic extracts contextual information just as a human user would by having access to the score awarded to a comment by other Reddit users; the post originally commented on; and the subreddit (community) being posted to. When combining this data with syntactic and semantic feature extraction, /u/IsThisSarcastic outperforms similar supervised learning-based sarcasm detectors, and approaches the performance enjoyed by state-of-the-art deep learning models.
