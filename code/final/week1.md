# Term 2, Week 1 Log
- Began implementation of solution; currently preprocessing and topic modelling are complete
- Added "sandbox" directory containing tests for sentiment analysis approaches using `VADER` and `SentiWordNet`; these appear to work as expected

## Week 2 plans
- Continue testing feature extraction areas and building up to generating a full feature extraction routine that can be used to train a classifier.
