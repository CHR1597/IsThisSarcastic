# Week 7 Log
- Ran `sarc.py` to collect comment data into more manageable `json` files.
- Began analysis of training/test data. Most common words in sarcastic comments from training data.
- Collected subset of test comments to use for survey.
- Phil suggested a change to the "introduce context" idea. Rather than all at once, do it in stages and see if each new piece of information "changes minds".

## Week 8 Plans
- Publish survey (probably Google Forms or SurveyMonkey)
- Begin researching `nltk` library sentiment analysis functionality.
