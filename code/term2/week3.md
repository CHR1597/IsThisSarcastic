# Term 2, Week 3 Log
- Following meeting with Phil, reworked the Reddit retrieval system so that it is available on disk to begin with
    - This prevents lengthy waits during feature extraction
- ~10000 comments currently with details
- Classifiers complete, values generated with and without Reddit integration for a corpus of 1000 total

## Week 4 plans
- Add more comments, get data for classifiers with more comments - are the strange patterns we see simply due to low training data
